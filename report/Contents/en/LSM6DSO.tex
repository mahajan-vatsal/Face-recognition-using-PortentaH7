\chapter{Sensor Inertial Mesure Unit}

Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) are an essential component of many navigation and control systems. These devices integrate several sensors, including accelerometers and gyroscopes, to measure and track an object's movements in three-dimensional space. IMUs are widely used in a variety of applications, such as autonomous vehicle navigation, virtual reality, image stabilization, and even in wearable devices for tracking physical activity. Their ability to provide precise data on linear and angular acceleration makes them indispensable tools for systems requiring precise control and orientation, and ongoing technological advances have reduced their size, power consumption and cost, widening their scope of application in many fields.

\section{General Description }

The Inertial Measurement Unit is used to mesured acceleration or rotation, this is an electronic device which used three types of sensor magnetometer, accelerometer and gyroscope. These three sensors is used in LSM9DS1 and they give velocity, orientation and gravital force. 

The magnetometer measures the strength of magnetic fields, providing various types of information. For instance, when you pass a current through an electromagnet or generate a magnetic field in another way, the magnetometer can detect and quantify the strength of that field. \cite{st_microelectronics:2024}
\cite{STMicroelectronics_LSM9DS1:2024}

\subsection{Always On Mode}

This feature implies that the LSM9DS1 can remain operational continuously, even when a device is in sleep mode, without excessively draining power. Such functionality proves invaluable for applications that require uninterrupted motion tracking, like fitness monitoring or navigation systems. \cite{st_microelectronics:2024}

\bigskip

The power consumption is an important factor when we have battery-powered device like smartphone. These devices need to be lightweight and portable, which requires minimizing battery weight and maximizing battery life.

\section{Specification}

\subsection{Accelerometer Sensor}

The accelerometer is composed by sensor type MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) and they used microscopic structures like suspended beams or springs, which deform in response to acceleration. The deformation of these structures is measured using displacement sensors or changes in electrical resistance. MEMS accelerometers are commonly used due to their small size, low power consumption, and comparatively lower cost compared to other types of accelerometers. \cite{pcb_mem_accelerometer:2024}

\bigskip 

The Accelerometer sensor function by \cite{mouser_memssensors:2024} : 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Acceleration Integration for Velocity Estimation: To estimate velocity, the acceleration measured by the accelerometer is integrated over time. Integrating acceleration over time yields velocity.
	
	\item Error Compensation: However, it's crucial to note that acceleration integration is susceptible to cumulative errors. Errors stemming from sensor noise, drift, and inaccuracies can accumulate over time, leading to inaccurate or biased velocity estimates.
	
	\item Utilization of Filters and Sensor Fusion Techniques: To compensate for these errors, advanced techniques such as Kalman filters, Complementary filters, or sensor fusion techniques can be employed. These techniques combine accelerometer data with other sensors such as gyroscopes to enhance velocity estimation accuracy.
	
	\item Calibration and Adjustment: It's also vital to calibrate and adjust the IMU to correct systematic errors and ensure precise measurements. This may involve steps such as compensating for Earth's gravity, correcting gyroscope drift, and reducing sensor noise. 
	
\end{itemize}
\subsection{PIN Conncetion}

They are 4 ways to connect pin, ways depend of what they have after \cite{st_microelectronics_lsm6dso32x:2024}. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Mode 1: You can utilize either the I\textsuperscript{2}C / MIPI I3CSM slave interface or the SPI (3- and 4-wire) serial interface.
	
	\item Mode 2: This mode supports both the I\textsuperscript{2}C / MIPI I3CSM slave interface or the SPI (3- and 4-wire) serial interface, along with an I\textsuperscript{2}C interface master for external sensor connections.
	
	\item Mode 3: Here, you have the choice of employing either the I\textsuperscript{2}C / MIPI I3CSM slave interface or the SPI (3- and 4-wire) serial interface for the application processor interface. Additionally, an auxiliary SPI (3- and 4-wire) serial interface is designated for external sensor connections, exclusively for the gyroscope.
	
	\item Mode 4: Similar to Mode 3, this mode offers the I\textsuperscript{2}C / MIPI I3CSM slave interface or the SPI (3- and 4-wire) serial interface for the application processor interface. Additionally, it provides an auxiliary SPI (3- and 4-wire) serial interface for external sensor connections, catering to both the accelerometer and gyroscope.

This function is used to stop or deactivate the IMU once it is no longer required. It frees up the resources used by the IMU and ends its operation cleanly. When called, it ensures that all tasks associated with the IMU are properly finalized, avoiding memory leaks or other problems associated with incomplete de-initialization.

This step helps to ensure the stability and reliability of the system as a whole, by avoiding problems associated with incorrect IMU de-initialization.

The data was return at the end. 

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Arduino]
	if (!IMU.begin()) {
		Serial.println("Failed to initialize IMU!");
		while (1); }
			
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Function \PYTHON{IMU.readAcceleration(x,y,z) }}

\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Function \PYTHON{IMU.accelerationSampleRate()}}

This function is designed to provide information on the sampling rate of the IMU's accelerometer. The function \PYTHON{IMU.accelerationSampleRate()} returns the accelerometer sampling rate, expressed in Hertz (Hz). This value represents the frequency at which the accelerometer takes measurements and provides acceleration data. It indicates how many times per second the accelerometer registers changes in acceleration along its axes. \cite{STMicroelectronics_LSM9DS1:2024}

In activities such as motion tracking, gesture recognition or vibration analysis, knowledge of the accelerometer's sampling rate ensures that the system can accurately capture and respond to changes in motion dynamics.
