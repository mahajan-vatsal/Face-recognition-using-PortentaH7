This example is designed to demonstrate the absolute basics of using \href{https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers}{\texttt{ Tensor\+Flow Lite for Microcontrollers}}. It includes the full end-\/to-\/end workflow of training a model, converting it for use with Tensor\+Flow Lite for Microcontrollers for running inference on a microcontroller.

The model is trained to replicate a {\ttfamily sine} function and generates a pattern of data to blink the built-\/in LED in a fade in/out pattern.\hypertarget{md__tensor_flow_lite_2_sine_wave_l_e_d_2_r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md415}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Table of contents}{Table of contents}}\label{md__tensor_flow_lite_2_sine_wave_l_e_d_2_r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md415}

The following instructions will help you build and deploy this sample to \href{https://www.arduino.cc/}{\texttt{ Arduino}} devices.

The sample has been tested with the following devices\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://store.arduino.cc/usa/nano-33-ble-sense-with-headers}{\texttt{ Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense}}
\item \href{https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-tiny-machine-learning-kit}{\texttt{ Arduino Tiny Machine Learning Kit}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

The sample will use PWM to fade an LED on and off according to the model\textquotesingle{}s output. In the code, the {\ttfamily LED\+\_\+\+BUILTIN} constant is used to specify the board\textquotesingle{}s built-\/in LED as the one being controlled. However, on some boards, this built-\/in LED is not attached to a pin with PWM capabilities. In this case, the LED will blink instead of fading.

To install the Tensor\+Flow Lite Micro for Arduino library, see the \href{../../README.md\#how-to-install}{\texttt{ how to install}} instructions.\hypertarget{md__tensor_flow_lite_2_sine_wave_l_e_d_2_r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md418}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Load and run the example}{Load and run the example}}\label{md__tensor_flow_lite_2_sine_wave_l_e_d_2_r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md418}
Once the library has been added, go to {\ttfamily File -\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Examples}. You should see an entry within the list named {\ttfamily Arduino\+\_\+\+Tensor\+Flow\+Lite}. Select it and click {\ttfamily hello\+\_\+world} to load the example.

Use the Arduino IDE to build and upload the example. Once it is running, you should see the built-\/in LED on your device flashing.

The Arduino Desktop IDE includes a plotter that we can use to display the sine wave graphically. To view it, go to {\ttfamily Tools -\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Serial Plotter}. You will see one datapoint being logged for each inference cycle, expressed as a number between 0 and 255.
