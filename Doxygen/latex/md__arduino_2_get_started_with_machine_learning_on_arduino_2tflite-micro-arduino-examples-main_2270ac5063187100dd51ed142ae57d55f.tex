This example shows how to run a 20 kB model that can recognize 2 keywords, "{}yes"{} and "{}no"{}, from speech data.

The application listens to its surroundings with a microphone and indicates when it has detected a word by lighting an LED or displaying data on a screen, depending on the capabilities of the device.



The code has a small footprint (for example, around 166 kilobytes on a Cortex M4) and only uses about 54 kilobytes of additional RAM for working memory.\hypertarget{md__arduino_2_get_started_with_machine_learning_on_arduino_2tflite-micro-arduino-examples-main_2270ac5063187100dd51ed142ae57d55f_autotoc_md19}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Table of contents}{Table of contents}}\label{md__arduino_2_get_started_with_machine_learning_on_arduino_2tflite-micro-arduino-examples-main_2270ac5063187100dd51ed142ae57d55f_autotoc_md19}

The following instructions will help you build and deploy this example to \href{https://www.arduino.cc/}{\texttt{ Arduino}} devices.

The example has been tested with the following devices\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://store.arduino.cc/usa/nano-33-ble-sense-with-headers}{\texttt{ Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

The Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense is currently the only Arduino with a built-\/in microphone. If you\textquotesingle{}re using a different Arduino board and attaching your own microphone, you\textquotesingle{}ll need to implement your own {\ttfamily audio\+\_\+provider.\+cpp} code. It also has a set of LEDs, which are used to indicate that a word has been recognized.\hypertarget{md__arduino_2_get_started_with_machine_learning_on_arduino_2tflite-micro-arduino-examples-main_2270ac5063187100dd51ed142ae57d55f_autotoc_md21}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Install the Arduino\+\_\+\+Tensor\+Flow\+Lite library}{Install the Arduino\+\_\+\+Tensor\+Flow\+Lite library}}\label{md__arduino_2_get_started_with_machine_learning_on_arduino_2tflite-micro-arduino-examples-main_2270ac5063187100dd51ed142ae57d55f_autotoc_md21}
This example application is included as part of the official Tensor\+Flow Lite Micro Arduino library. To install the Tensor\+Flow Lite Micro for Arduino library, see the \href{../../README.md\#how-to-install}{\texttt{ how to install}} instructions.\hypertarget{md__arduino_2_get_started_with_machine_learning_on_arduino_2tflite-micro-arduino-examples-main_2270ac5063187100dd51ed142ae57d55f_autotoc_md22}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Load and run the example}{Load and run the example}}\label{md__arduino_2_get_started_with_machine_learning_on_arduino_2tflite-micro-arduino-examples-main_2270ac5063187100dd51ed142ae57d55f_autotoc_md22}
Once the library has been added, go to {\ttfamily File -\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Examples}. You should see an entry within the list named {\ttfamily Arduino\+\_\+\+Tensor\+Flow\+Lite}. Select it and click {\ttfamily micro\+\_\+speech} to load the example.

Use the Arduino IDE to build and upload the example. Once it is running, you should see the built-\/in LED on your device flashing. The built-\/in LED will flash on/off for each inference cycle. Saying the word "{}yes"{} will cause the green LED to remain on for 3 seconds. The current model has fairly low accuracy, so you may have to repeat "{}yes"{} a few times. Saying the word "{}no"{} will cause the red LED to light up. The blue LED will be lit for certain "{}unknown"{} sounds.

Word recognition should occur at a distance of approximately 1.\+5 feet in a low-\/noise environment.

The program also outputs inference results to the serial port, which appear as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Heard\ yes\ (201)\ @4056ms}
\DoxyCodeLine{Heard\ no\ (205)\ @6448ms}
\DoxyCodeLine{Heard\ unknown\ (201)\ @13696ms}
\DoxyCodeLine{Heard\ yes\ (205)\ @15000ms}

\end{DoxyCode}


The number after each detected word is its score. By default, the program only considers matches as valid if their score is over 200, so all of the scores you see will be at least 200.

When the program is run, it waits several seconds for a USB-\/serial connection to be available. If there is no connection available, it will not output data. To see the serial output in the Arduino desktop IDE, do the following\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Open the Arduino IDE
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Connect the Arduino board to your computer via USB
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Press the reset button on the Arduino board
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Within 5 seconds, go to {\ttfamily Tools -\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Serial Monitor} in the Arduino IDE. You may have to try several times, since the board will take a moment to connect.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

If you don\textquotesingle{}t see any output, repeat the process again.
