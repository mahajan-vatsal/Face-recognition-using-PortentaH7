  title       = {Deep Learning using Rectified Linear Units (ReLU)},
  abstract    = {We introduce the use of rectified linear units (ReLU) as the classification function in a deep neural network (DNN). Conventionally, ReLU is used as an activation function in DNNs, with Softmax function as their classification function. However, there have been several studies on using a classification function other than Softmax, and this study is an addition to those. We accomplish this by taking the activation of the penultimate layer $h_{n - 1}$ in a neural network, then multiply it by weight parameters $\theta$ to get the raw scores $o_{i}$. Afterwards, we threshold the raw scores $o_{i}$ by $0$, i.e. $f(o) = \max(0, o_{i})$, where $f(o)$ is the ReLU function. We provide class predictions $\hat{y}$ through argmax function, i.e. argmax $f(x)$.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a comparison of six machine learning (ML) algorithms: GRU-SVM[1], Linear Regression, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Nearest Neighbor (NN) search, Softmax Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset[2] by measuring their classification test accuracy, and their sensitivity and specificity values. The said dataset consists of features which were computed from digitized images of FNA tests on a breast mass[2]. For the implementation of the ML algorithms, the dataset was partitioned in the following fashion: 70\% for training phase, and 30% for the testing phase. The hyper-parameters used for all the classifiers were manually assigned. Results show that all the presented ML algorithms performed well (all exceeded 90% test accuracy) on the classification task. The MLP algorithm stands out among the implemented algorithms with a test accuracy of ≈99.04%.},

Brown and Sandholm built a poker-playing AI called Libratus that decisively beat four leading human professionals in the two-player variant of poker called heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em (HUNL). Over nearly 3 weeks, Libratus played 120,000 hands of HUNL against the human professionals, using a three-pronged approach that included precomputing an overall strategy, adapting the strategy to actual gameplay, and learning from its opponent.Science, this issue p. 418No-limit Texas hold{\textquoteright}em is the most popular form of poker. Despite artificial intelligence (AI) successes in perfect-information games, the private information and massive game tree have made no-limit poker difficult to tackle. We present Libratus, an AI that, in a 120,000-hand competition, defeated four top human specialist professionals in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em, the leading benchmark and long-standing challenge problem in imperfect-information game solving. Our game-theoretic approach features application-independent techniques: an algorithm for computing a blueprint for the overall strategy, an algorithm that fleshes out the details of the strategy for subgames that are reached during play, and a self-improver algorithm that fixes potential weaknesses that opponents have identified in the blueprint strategy.},

  abstract    = {We present a library of efficient implementations of deep learning primitives. Deep learning workloads are computationally intensive, and optimizing their kernels is difficult and time-consuming. As parallel architectures evolve, kernels must be reoptimized, which makes maintaining codebases difficult over time. Similar issues have long been addressed in the HPC community by libraries such as the Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS). However, there is no analogous library for deep learning. Without such a library, researchers implementing deep learning workloads on parallel processors must create and optimize their own implementations of the main computational kernels, and this work must be repeated as new parallel processors emerge. To address this problem, we have created a library similar in intent to BLAS, with optimized routines for deep learning workloads. Our implementation contains routines for GPUs, although similarly to the BLAS library, these routines could be implemented for other platforms. The library is easy to integrate into existing frameworks, and provides optimized performance and memory usage. For example, integrating cuDNN into Caffe, a popular framework for convolutional networks, improves performance by 36\% on a standard model while also reducing memory consumption.},

These techniques consist mostly in operation rescheduling and hardware reutilization, allowing a significant reduction of the critical path while the required area also decreases. Both SHA256 and SHA512 hash functions have been implemented and tested in the VIRTEX II Pro prototyping technology. Experimental results suggest improvements to related SHA256 art above 50{\%} when compared with commercial cores and 100{\%} to academia art, and above 70{\%} for the SHA512 hash function. The resulting cores are capable of achieving the same throughput as the fastest unrolled architectures with 25{\%} less area occupation than the smallest proposed architectures. The proposed cores achieve a throughput of 1.4 Gbit/s and 1.8 Gbit/s with a slice requirement of 755 and 1667 for SHA256 and SHA512 respectively, on a XC2VP30-7 FPGA.},

  abstract = {The goal of this review is to assess renewable power sources as alternatives to the batteries traditionally used for remote environmental monitoring. In this review, we first discuss remote sensors and then we: 1) review the power requirements and traditionally used power sources for remote sensors, 2) describe the working principles of the renewable power sources used for powering remote sensors, 3) evaluate the challenges and potentials of the renewable power sources, and 4) review the power management systems developed for remote power generation and discuss how to use them to generate reliable power. In the description of each of the renewable power sources, we include the current status and future directions of the research. We believe that hybrid systems using more than a single renewable power source can provide more reliable renewable power. We conclude that renewable power sources have been demonstrated to be able to generate sufficient power for remote sensors. Because of the environmental risks and cost of operation associated with batteries, renewable energy sources will need to be used to power remote sensors in the near future.}

  abstract = {Image quality is an important practical challenge that is often overlooked in the design of machine vision systems. Commonly, machine vision systems are trained and tested on high quality image datasets, yet in practical applications the input images can not be assumed to be of high quality. Recently, deep neural networks have obtained state-of-the-art performance on many machine vision tasks. In this paper we provide an evaluation of 4 state-of-the-art deep neural network models for image classification under quality distortions. We consider five types of quality distortions: blur, noise, contrast, JPEG, and JPEG2000 compression. We show that the existing networks are susceptible to these quality distortions, particularly to blur and noise. These results enable future work in developing deep neural networks that are more invariant to quality distortions.},

  abstract = {In the last few years, deep learning has led to very good performance on a variety of problems, such as visual recognition, speech recognition and natural language processing. Among different types of deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks have been most extensively studied. Leveraging on the rapid growth in the amount of the annotated data and the great improvements in the strengths of graphics processor units, the research on convolutional neural networks has been emerged swiftly and achieved state-of-the-art results on various tasks. In this paper, we provide a broad survey of the recent advances in convolutional neural networks. We detailize the improvements of CNN on different aspects, including layer design, activation function, loss function, regularization, optimization and fast computation. Besides, we also introduce various applications of convolutional neural networks in computer vision, speech and natural language processing.},

Usually this capacity (in a colloquial sense) of the powerbanks is stated in the form of charge in mAh for effective advertising. From a physical point of view, shouldn't the energy that a powerbank can provide be of interest? For students, charging smartphones with power banks is commonplace—but the terms voltage, current, power, charge and energy are often not understood clearly. Since misunderstandings can also be expected on this subject, a more detailed analysis of the characteristics of powerbanks provides an opportunity for a context- and life-oriented physics education. In combination with microcontrollers such as the Arduino, simple, inexpensive computer-based experiments and measurements are possible. In this article we present a measurement circuit (see figure 1) for the Arduino, with which series of measurements on the characteristics of various powerbanks can be recorded and evaluated during discharge. Example measurements of various powerbanks are shown and discussed.}

MobileNets are based on a streamlined architecture that uses depth-wise separable convolutions to build light weight deep neural networks. We introduce two simple global hyper-parameters that efficiently trade off between latency and accuracy. These hyper-parameters allow the model builder to choose the right sized model for their application based on the constraints of the problem. We present extensive experiments on resource and accuracy tradeoffs and show strong performance compared to other popular models on ImageNet classification. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of MobileNets across a wide range of applications and use cases including object detection, finegrain classification, face attributes and large scale geo-localization.},

  abstract      = {A growing number of applications implement predictive functions using deep learning models, which require heavy use of compute and memory. One popular technique for increasing resource efficiency is 8-bit integer quantization, in which 32-bit floating point numbers (fp32) are represented using shorter 8-bit integer numbers. Although deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, TFLite, MXNet, and PyTorch enable developers to quantize models with only a small drop in accuracy, they are not well suited to execute quantized models on a variety of hardware platforms. For example, TFLite is optimized to run inference on ARM CPU edge devices but it does not have efficient support for Intel CPUs and Nvidia GPUs. In this paper, we address the challenges of executing quantized deep learning models on diverse hardware platforms by proposing an augmented compiler approach. A deep learning compiler such as Apache TVM can enable the efficient execution of model from various frameworks on various targets. Many deep learning compilers today, however, are designed primarily for fp32 computation and cannot optimize a pre-quantized INT8 model. To address this issue, we created a new dialect called Quantized Neural Network (QNN) that extends the compiler's internal representation with a quantization context. With this quantization context, the compiler can generate efficient code for pre-quantized models on various hardware platforms. As implemented in Apache TVM, we observe that the QNN-augmented deep learning compiler achieves speedups of 2.35x, 2.15x, 1.35x and 1.40x on Intel Xeon Cascade Lake CPUs, Nvidia Tesla T4 GPUs, ARM Raspberry Pi3 and Pi4 respectively against well optimized fp32 execution, and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art framework-specific solutions.},

Some of the exciting application areas of CNN include Image Classification and Segmentation, Object Detection, Video Processing, Natural Language Processing, and Speech Recognition. The powerful learning ability of deep CNN is primarily due to the use of multiple feature extraction stages that can automatically learn representations from the data. The availability of a large amount of data and improvement in the hardware technology has accelerated the research in CNNs, and recently interesting deep CNN architectures have been reported. Several inspiring ideas to bring advancements in CNNs have been explored, such as the use of different activation and loss functions, parameter optimization, regularization, and architectural innovations. However, the significant improvement in the representational capacity of the deep CNN is achieved through architectural innovations. Notably, the ideas of exploiting spatial and channel information, depth and width of architecture, and multi-path information processing have gained substantial attention. Similarly, the idea of using a block of layers as a structural unit is also gaining popularity. This survey thus focuses on the intrinsic taxonomy present in the recently reported deep CNN architectures and, consequently, classifies the recent innovations in CNN architectures into seven different categories. These seven categories are based on spatial exploitation, depth, multi-path, width, feature-map exploitation, channel boosting, and attention. Additionally, the elementary understanding of CNN components, current challenges, and applications of CNN are also provided.},

In doing so, license plates attached, especially, on cars will be the test subject of this research. The ANPR is already implemented within the barrier gate parking system. It is able to record the data of the vehicles that come in yet it doesn’t necessarily recognize or identify the license plates installed on the vehicles. The fundamental goal of the ANPR program itself is actually to utilize digital image identification system in order to identify every single vehicle that goes in and out through the barrier gate parking system. From the result of the experimentation, the ANPR is able to detect and translate the license plates into a form of text in less than one second with 100% accuracy for high quality image, 82.6% for medium quality and 44.5% for low quality image. Series of analysis that the ANPR program situates involves; analysis on the ratio of the license plate, experimentation on the distance of license plate detection process, comparison between binary calculation methods using Adaptive Threshold and Global Threshold, and overall system examination. The result retrieved from the conducted analysis can be considered as a part of the ANPR system}

  abstract = {Because of the ``all-or-none'' character of nervous activity, neural events and the relations among them can be treated by means of propositional logic. It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},

Novel incremental ensemble learners are explained along with one of the largest ensemble learning (in effort estimation) experiments yet attempted. It turns out that the specific goals of the learning has an effect on what is learned and, for this reason, this part also explores multigoal reasoning. We show that multigoal optimizers can significantly improve effort estimation results.},

Unlike the rest of the ocean of literature on individual chips, Microcontrollers in Practice supplies side-by-side comparisons and an overview that treats the systems as resources available for implementation. Packed with hundreds of practical examples and exercises to foster mastery of concepts and details, the guide also includes several extended projects. By treating the less expensive 8-bit and RISC microcontrollers, this information-dense manual equips students and home-experimenters with the know-how to put these devices into operation.},

  abstract    = {Deep neural networks have been successfully used in diverse emerging domains to solve real world complex problems with may more deep learning(DL) architectures, being developed to date. To achieve these state-of-the-art performances, the DL architectures use activation functions (AFs), to perform diverse computations between the hidden layers and the output layers of any given DL architecture. This paper presents a survey on the existing AFs used in deep learning applications and highlights the recent trends in the use of the activation functions for deep learning applications. The novelty of this paper is that it compiles majority of the AFs used in DL and outlines the current trends in the applications and usage of these functions in practical deep learning deployments against the state-of-the-art research results. This compilation will aid in making effective decisions in the choice of the most suitable and appropriate activation function for any given application, ready for deployment. This paper is timely because most research papers on AF highlights similar works and results while this paper will be the first, to compile the trends in AF applications in practice against the research results from literature, found in deep learning research to date.},

  abstract = {As one of the most promising new energy sources, the lithium-ion battery (LIB) and its associated safety concerns have attracted great research interest. Herein, a comprehensive review on the thermal hazards of LIBs and the corresponding countermeasures is provided. In general, the thermal hazards of the LIB can be caused or aggravated by several factors including physical, electrical and thermal factors, manufacturing defect and even battery aging. Due to the activity and combustibility of traditional battery components, they usually possess a relatively high thermal hazard and a series of side reactions between electrodes and electrolytes may occur under abusive conditions, which would further lead to the thermal failure of LIBs. Besides, the thermal hazards generally manifest as the thermal runaway behaviors such as high-temperature, ejection, combustion, explosion and toxic gases for a single battery, and it can even evolve to thermal failure propagation within a battery pack. To decrease these hazards, some countermeasures are reviewed including the application of safety devices, fire-retardant additives, battery management systems, hazard warnings and firefighting should a hazard occur.},

Destination knowledge management requires a multidisciplinary approach and an understanding of tourism. Research and information technology together are imperative to be successful in KDD and data mining. Since useful knowledge management systems must be timely, the destination knowledge discovery system can be a perpetual prototype requiring frequent updating with emphasis on speed in responses and updating. This article discusses various aspects of KDD including operational issues, applications, and data mining. In addition, a hypothetical example of the KDD is provided using Cheju Island in South Korea.},

	year     = 2021,
	abstract = {Broadening access to both computational and educational resources is critical to diffusing machine-learning (ML) innovation. However, today, most ML resources and experts are siloed in a few countries and organizations. In this paper, we describe our pedagogical ap- proach to increasing access to applied ML through a massive open online course (MOOC) on Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML). We suggest that TinyML, ML on resource-constrained embedded de- vices, is an attractive means to widen access because TinyML both leverages low-cost and globally accessible hardware, and encour- ages the development of complete, self-contained applications, from data collection to deployment. To this end, a collaboration between academia (Harvard University) and industry (Google) produced a four-part MOOC that provides application-oriented instruction on how to develop solutions using TinyML. The series is openly avail- able on the edX MOOC platform, has no prerequisites beyond basic programming, and is designed for learners from a global variety of backgrounds. It introduces pupils to real-world applications, ML algorithms, data-set engineering, and the ethical considerations of these technologies via hands-on programming and deployment of TinyML applications in both the cloud and their own microcon- trollers. To facilitate continued learning, community building, and collaboration beyond the courses, we launched a standalone web- site, a forum, a chat, and an optional course-project competition. We also released the course materials publicly, hoping they will inspire the next generation of ML practitioners and educators and further broaden access to cutting-edge ML technologies.},

@online{Redmon:2015,
  abstract  = {We present YOLO, a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance.  Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},

  Description = {In this article, they determine the way to train object detectors from scratch in a sound way. They started by analysing the previous work on optimization landscape, they found that one of the overlooked points in current trained-from-scratch detector is the BatchNorm. By relying on the stable and predictable gradients of BatchNorm, they trained the detector stably from the beginning while maintaining good performance regardless of the network architecture. Taking this as an advantage, they were able to explore different kinds of networks for object detection, without suffering from the backlash of poor convergence. Through extensive experimentation and analysis on downsampling factors, they have proposed the Root-ResNet backbone network, which makes the most of the information contained in the original image. Thier ScratchDet achieved state-of-the-art accuracy among all train-from-scratch detectors on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO, even better than some single-stage pre-trained methods.}

A typical and popular method for solving classification problems on datasets such as the Iris set is the support vector machine (SVM). In order to do so the dataset is separated in a set used for training and a set used for testing. The error rate, after training, for the training set should be lower than the error rate on the test set. However, in this paper we show that when solving the classification problem for the Iris dataset with SVMs this is not the case. Therefore, we provide an analysis of the Iris dataset and the classification models in order to find the origin of this interesting observation.},

In our year-long experiment, trained humans first annotated 40,000 images from the ImageNet and ImageNetV2 test sets with multi-class labels to enable a semantically coherent evaluation. Then we measured the classification accuracy of the five trained humans on the full task with 1,000 classes. Only the latest models from 2020 are on par with our best human labeler, and human accuracy on the 590 object classes is still 4\% and 10\% higher than the best model on ImageNet and ImageNetV2, respectively. Moreover, humans achieve the same accuracy on ImageNet and ImageNetV2, while all models see a consistent accuracy drop. Overall, our results show that there is still substantial room for improvement on ImageNet and direct accuracy comparisons between humans and machines may overstate machine performance.},

  abstract = {Over the last decade, the electric vehicle (EV) has significantly changed the car industry globally, driven by the fast development of Li-ion battery technology. However, the fire risk and hazard associated with this type of high-energy battery has become a major safety concern for EVs. This review focuses on the latest fire-safety issues of EVs related to thermal runaway and fire in Li-ion batteries. Thermal runaway or fire can occur as a result of extreme abuse conditions that may be the result of the faulty operation or traffic accidents. Failure of the battery may then be accompanied by the release of toxic gas, fire, jet flames, and explosion. This paper is devoted to reviewing the battery fire in battery EVs, hybrid EVs, and electric buses to provide a qualitative understanding of the fire risk and hazards associated with battery powered EVs. In addition, important battery fire characteristics involved in various EV fire scenarios, obtained through testing, are analysed. The tested peak heat release rate (PHHR in MW) varies with the energy capacity of LIBs ({\$}{\$}E{\_}{\{}B{\}}{\$}{\$}in Wh) crossing different scales as {\$}{\$}PHRR = 2E{\_}{\{}B{\}}\^{}{\{}0.6{\}}{\$}{\$}. For the full-scale EV fire test, limited data have revealed that the heat release and hazard of an EV fire are comparable to that of a fossil-fuelled vehicle fire. Once the onboard battery involved in fire, there is a greater difficulty in suppressing EV fires, because the burning battery pack inside is inaccessible to externally applied suppressant and can re-ignite without sufficient cooling. As a result, an excessive amount of suppression agent is needed to cool the battery, extinguish the fire, and prevent reignition. By addressing these concerns, this review aims to aid researchers and industries working with batteries, EVs and fire safety engineering, to encourage active research collaborations, and attract future research and development on improving the overall safety of future EVs. Only then will society achieve the same comfort level for EVs as they have for conventional vehicles.},

  abstract  = {Nowadays, charging portable devices like mobile devices through power banks is very common and is required. In this paper, the drawbacks of existing power banks are discussed and are required to upgrade with novel and reliable technology. The mobile devices need to be recharged whenever its charging is completed, that’s why power banks came into the market to recharge portable devices such as mobile devices. As the load increases, the charging will be degraded and needs to be charged. The charging phenomenon that existing power banks use is time-consuming. The factor time plays an important role in modern days because many activities need to be done at that time. The scheduled activities to be disturbed because of the lack of charging while involved in traveling for long hours and the days. When there is a technology added in the power banks where the portable devices are charged instantly by scanning the power bank charged code using recipient mobile (Portable device). The charging of the portable device is done in nanoseconds. This greatly reduces the amount of time spent on charging over portable devices using existing power banks. Functionality and performance are demonstrated in the proposed and results chapter. In this, the amount of charging is also to be customized so that the leftover charging in the power bank to be used for charging the other portable device.}

  abstract      = {In this article gesture recognition and speech recognition applications are implemented on embedded systems with Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML). It features 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis magnetometer. The gesture recognition,provides an innovative approach nonverbal communication. It has wide applications in human-computer interaction and sign language. Here in the implementation of hand gesture recognition, TinyML model is trained and deployed from EdgeImpulse framework for hand gesture recognition and based on the hand movements, Arduino Nano 33 BLE device having 6-axis IMU can find out the direction of movement of hand. The Speech is a mode of communication. Speech recognition is a way by which the statements or commands of human speech is understood by the computer which reacts accordingly. The main aim of speech recognition is to achieve communication between man and machine. Here in the implementation of speech recognition, TinyML model is trained and deployed from EdgeImpulse framework for speech recognition and based on the keywords pronounced by human, Arduino Nano 33 BLE device having built-in microphone can make an RGB LED glow like red, green or blue based on keyword pronounced. The results of each application are obtained and listed in the results section and given the analysis upon the results.},

  abstract = {Since the surface electromyography signal (sEMG) is a weak and unstable signal, human action recognition based on sEMG time domain or frequency domain feature extraction has poor stability and low recognition rate. Based on modeling analysis of sEMG, the dual-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) is built to perform feature fusion of sEMG energy kernel phase portrait and inertial measurement unit(IMU) data for gesture recognition in this paper. Firstly, methods of matrix counting method and time window amplitude are utilized to represent the sEMG and IMU data as images. Secondly, the moving average method is presented to filter the images. Thirdly, the dual-stream CNN is used to perform feature extraction, fusion and classification of sEMG and IMU images respectively. Finally, the experiments yield an average recognition accuracy of 95.78% for 6 gestures performed by 5 subjects, which demonstrates that the proposed method has better performance for human gestures recognition.}
