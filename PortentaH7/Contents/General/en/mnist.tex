\subsection{Data Set MNIST}

The dataset MNIST\index{Dataset!MNIST} is available for free use and contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits with the corresponding correct classification. \cite{Deng:2009,Deng:2012} The name of the dataset is justified by its origin, as it is a \textbf{m}modified dataset from two datasets from the US \textbf{N}ational \textbf{I}nstitute of \textbf{S}tandards and \textbf{T}echnology. These contain handwritten digits from 250 different people, consisting of US Census Bureau employees and high school students. The \ac{sd-3} and \ac{sd-1} datasets collected in this way were merged because the former dataset of clerical workers contains cleaner and more easily recognisable data. Initially, \ac{sd-3} was used as the training set and \ac{sd-1} as the test set, but because of the differences, it makes more sense to merge the two. The dataset is already split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. \cite{LeCun:2013,Nielsen:2015}

The data is provided in four files, two for the training dataset and two for the test dataset, one of which contains the image data and the other the associated labels:


\begin{itemize}
    \item \FILE{train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz}:  Training pictures (9912422 bytes)
    \item \FILE{train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz}:  Classification of the training data (28881 bytes)
    \item \FILE{t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz}:  Test patterns (1648877 bytes)
    \item \FILE{t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz}:  Classification of the test patterns (4542 bytes)
\end{itemize}


The images in the dataset MNIST\index{Dataset!MNIST} are greyscale images of size $28 \times 28$ pixels.\cite{LeCun:2013} The data is in IDX file format and so cannot be opened and visualised by default. However, you can write a programme to convert the data into CSV format or load a variant in CSV format directly from other websites. \cite{Redmon:2020}


The library TensorFlow provides the dataset MNIST\index{Dataset!MNIST} under \PYTHON{tensorflow\_datasets}. This is not the only dataset provided by TensorFlow. A list of all datasets that can be loaded via so can be found in \href{https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview#all_datasets}{catalogue of datasets}\index{Dataset!TensorFlow}.
