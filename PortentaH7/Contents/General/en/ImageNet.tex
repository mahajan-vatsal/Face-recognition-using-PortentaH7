\subsection{ImageNet}

ImageNet\index{Dataset!ImageNet}\index{ImageNet!\see{Dataset}} is an image database with more than 14 million images that is constantly growing. Each image is assigned to a noun. For each category there are on average more than 500 images. ImageNet contains more than 20,000 categories in English with a typical category such as \glqq balloon\grqq{} or \glqq strawberry\grqq. The database of third-party image URL annotations is freely accessible directly through ImageNet, although the actual images are not owned by ImageNet. \cite{Deng:2009,Shankar:2020,Krizhevsky:2012b}
